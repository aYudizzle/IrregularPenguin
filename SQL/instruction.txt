1. import those SQL files in your database to setup the database structure
2. go to the package com.besteleben.feature_irregularpenguin.data.repository and edit the Impl (Highscore and Vocabulary) with ur database credentials (the easiest but not the safest way to do it)
3. then just go into the package com.besteleben.feature_login.repository and edit the login credentials there too.

IMPORTANT! It's not the safest way to save those credentials in your code directly but it should do it for ur own use.
